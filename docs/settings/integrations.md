# Integrations Settings

These settings control the integration with other plugins and services, such as Bases and external calendars.

## Bases Integration

TaskNotes v4 uses Obsidian's Bases core plugin for its main views. For setup instructions, see [Core Concepts](../core-concepts.md#bases-integration).

### View Commands Configuration

View command settings map TaskNotes commands and ribbon actions to specific `.base` files. This is useful when you maintain custom variants of the default views and want first-class command access to those files.

Access these settings in **Settings → TaskNotes → General → View Commands**.

Default mappings:

- **Open Mini Calendar View** → `TaskNotes/Views/mini-calendar-default.base`
- **Open Kanban View** → `TaskNotes/Views/kanban-default.base`
- **Open Tasks View** → `TaskNotes/Views/tasks-default.base`
- **Open Calendar View** → `TaskNotes/Views/calendar-default.base`
- **Open Agenda View** → `TaskNotes/Views/agenda-default.base`
- **Pomodoro Statistics Base** → `TaskNotes/Views/pomodoro-stats.base`
- **Relationships Widget** → `TaskNotes/Views/relationships.base`

Each command allows you to specify a custom `.base` file path and includes a reset button to restore the default path.

**Create Default Files**: Button to generate all default `.base` files in the `TaskNotes/Views/` directory. Existing files are not overwritten.

The generated Pomodoro statistics Base reads Pomodoro sessions from daily notes frontmatter. If your Pomodoro history is still stored in plugin data, migrate it from **Settings → TaskNotes → Features** before using that Base file.

## OAuth Calendar Integration

Connect Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook to sync events bidirectionally with TaskNotes. Events automatically refresh every 15 minutes and sync when local changes are made (such as dragging events to reschedule).

Enable **Disable calendar integrations on mobile** when you sync TaskNotes settings between desktop and mobile but do not want Obsidian Mobile to load external calendars on startup. The setting only affects mobile devices; desktop calendar integrations continue to run normally.

### Setup Requirements

OAuth integration requires creating your own OAuth application with Google and/or Microsoft. Initial setup takes approximately 15 minutes per provider.

**Setup Guide**: See [Calendar Integration Setup](../calendar-setup.md) for detailed instructions on creating OAuth credentials with Google Cloud Console and Azure Portal.

### Google Calendar

Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console, then use **Connect Google Calendar** to complete OAuth loopback authentication. **Disconnect** revokes local credentials.

The **Target calendar** setting used for exporting tasks to Google Calendar is also used as the default selection when creating a manual external calendar event from the calendar view. If the target calendar is unavailable, TaskNotes falls back to the provider's primary calendar.

Use **Event creation** to choose whether eligible tasks create Google Calendar events automatically or only when you click **Create Google Calendar event** from a task modal. Manually linked tasks still sync later task updates, completions, and deletions with their linked event.

For timed task exports, **Default reminder** accepts one or more minute offsets separated by commas, such as `60, 1440`. All-day task exports use the target Google Calendar's default reminder settings.

When connected, displays:
- Connected account email
- Connection time
- Last sync time
- Manual refresh button

### Microsoft Outlook Calendar

Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Azure App Registration, then use **Connect Microsoft Calendar** to authenticate. **Disconnect** removes stored credentials and sync access.

When connected, displays:
- Connected account email
- Connection time
- Last sync time

### Security

- OAuth credentials are stored locally in Obsidian's data folder
- Access tokens refresh automatically
- Calendar data syncs directly between Obsidian and the calendar provider (no intermediary servers)
- Disconnect at any time to revoke access

## Calendar subscriptions (ICS)

ICS settings define how subscribed calendar events are represented in your vault. You can set a default template, destination folder, filename strategy, and custom filename template for generated notes. Use **Add Calendar Subscription** to register URLs or local files, and **Refresh all subscriptions** for manual synchronization.

## Automatic ICS export

Automatic export keeps an ICS feed of your tasks updated on a schedule. Configure whether it is enabled, where the file is written (vault-relative path), the refresh interval, and use **Export now** for immediate output.

Export filters can omit archived tasks, completed tasks, tasks without due dates, or tasks without scheduled dates. When both due-date and scheduled-date requirements are enabled, exported tasks must have both dates.

## HTTP API

HTTP API settings control the local server lifecycle, listening port, and request authentication token.

Changes to API enablement or port require an Obsidian restart to take effect.

!!! warning
    The HTTP API binds to loopback only and browser CORS is limited to loopback origins. If the authentication token is empty, local API requests are still unauthenticated. Set a token unless your local environment is fully trusted.

## Webhooks

- **Add Webhook**: Register a new webhook endpoint.
